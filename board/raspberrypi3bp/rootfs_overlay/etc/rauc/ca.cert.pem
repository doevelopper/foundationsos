# RAUC CA certificate placeholder
# Replace this file with the actual RAUC CA certificate (PEM format) during key generation.
# See keys/rauc/README.md for instructions.
#
# The RAUC CA certificate is shared across all FoundationsOS boards.
# After running keys/rauc/gen-keys.sh, copy the generated ca.cert.pem here:
#
#   cp keys/rauc/ca.cert.pem \
#      board/raspberrypi3bp/rootfs_overlay/etc/rauc/ca.cert.pem
#
# The private key (ca.key.pem) MUST be stored offline and NOT committed to VCS.
