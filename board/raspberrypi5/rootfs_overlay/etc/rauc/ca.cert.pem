# RAUC CA certificate placeholder
# Replace this file with the actual RAUC CA certificate (PEM format) during key generation.
# See keys/rauc/README.md for instructions.
#
# Generate with:
#   openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-521 \
#     -keyout ca.key.pem -out ca.cert.pem \
#     -days 7300 -nodes \
#     -subj "/CN=FoundationsOS RAUC CA/O=FoundationsOS/C=US"
#
# The private key (ca.key.pem) MUST be stored offline and NOT committed to this repository.
# Only the public certificate (ca.cert.pem) is shipped on-device.
