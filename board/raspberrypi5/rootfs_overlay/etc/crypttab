# /etc/crypttab — LUKS device mapping table

# Format: <name>  <device>  <keyfile>  <options>
#
# The data partition is opened by luks-data.service using a TPM-unsealed key.
# This entry is provided for reference and manual recovery use.
# Normal boot uses luks-init.sh (called by luks-data.service) which unseals
# the key from the TPM rather than reading it from a file.
#
# For manual recovery (after firmware change breaks TPM PCR policy):
#   1. Boot from trusted recovery media
#   2. Re-seal with new PCRs: scripts/luks-tpm-seal.sh seal <keyfile>
#   3. Or supply a backup recovery key:
#      cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p4 luks-data --key-file /path/to/recovery.key

# luks-data  /dev/mmcblk0p4  none  luks
